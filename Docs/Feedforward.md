# Tips for Feedback Conversations

## Preparation

> Determine for yourself what you would like feedback on. Write down a few points in advance where you definitely want to receive feedback. This way, the feedback conversation will be more focused and the questions you definitely want answered will be addressed.

## During the Conversation:

> **Listen actively:** Do not immediately go on the defensive but try to listen well. Show both verbally and non-verbally that you are paying attention to the feedback by maintaining an open posture (eye contact, upright posture), taking notes, nodding...

> **Take notes:** Write down the feedback so you have it later. Note the key words and find a quick notation method for yourself. If you take good notes, you can briefly review your main feedback points at the end of the conversation.

> **Summarize:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Be open to the feedback:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Think about it:** Consider what you are going to do with the feedback and follow up. Do you find the comments justified or unjustified? Do you recognize yourself in the feedback? How are you going to address this?

## AFTER THE CONVERSATION

> Reread your notes and create action points. Make choices from all the feedback you received: What can you work on and what will you set aside for now. What were the priorities? Review the assignment sheet again to determine your focus points. Write your action points on the feedback sheet.
